# react-rtk-github-issues-example-using-easy-peasy

In order to understand the differences between [Redux Toolkit](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit) and [easy-peasy](https://github.com/ctrlplusb/easy-peasy) I have "converted" the Redux Toolkit advanced [Tutorial](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/tutorials/advanced-tutorial) [(source-code)](https://github.com/reduxjs/rtk-github-issues-example) to using easy-peasy. My intention was to "convert" the state manangement without touching the original code unless it was related to Redux Toolkit. After some reasearch I also couldn't find a good example of a larger app using "easy-peasy" [(Kutt.it is worth checking out)](https://github.com/thedevs-network/kutt) so maybe this can also help also other easy-peasy newcomers! I would like to keep one branch of the repo as close as possible to the rtk example, and also have another branch with "easy-peasy-bestpractices", feel free to PR.

(rtk guys, sorry for stealing your app!)
